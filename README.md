# Elm rich text editor

**NOTE:** This repo was an early prototype used mainly for me to test out an approach to creating a rich text editor and is only here for historical reasons.  If you want to create your own rich text editor, please see the Elm package [mweiss/elm-rte-toolkit](https://github.com/mweiss/elm-rte-toolkit).

This app is a prototype of a rich text editor written in Elm.  It is an editor written with `contenteditable`, based
heavily on projects like Draft.js and Slate.

This app was bootstrapped with create-elm-app.  To see how to run this project, see `Create-Elm-App-README.md`.
